// Diameter of Binary Tree (Aditya Verma)

// T.C = O(n)
// S.C = O(1)
// as no additional space or data structures is created that is proportional to the input size of the tree. O(H) Recursive 
// Stack Auxiliary Space: The recursion stack space is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion, which is the height of 
// the binary tree denoted as H. In the balanced case it is log2N and in the worst case its N.
