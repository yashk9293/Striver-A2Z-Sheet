// MERGE SORT - STRIVER 

// Merge sort is a Recursive Algorithm that continuously splits the array in half until it cannot be further divided i.e., 
// the array has only one element left (an array with one element is always sorted). Then the sorted subarrays are merged 
// into one sorted array.

// it is faster than bubble, selection and insertion sort.


// T.C - O(N log(N))
// The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(Nlog(N)) in all 3 cases (worst, average, and best) as merge sort always divides 
// the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.

// Auxiliary Space: O(N), In merge sort all elements are copied into an auxiliary array. So N auxiliary space is required for 
// merge sort.
